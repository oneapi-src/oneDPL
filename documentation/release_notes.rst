Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) Release Notes
###################################################

Overview
=========

The Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) accompanies the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler
and provides high-productivity APIs aimed to minimize programming efforts of C++ developers
creating efficient heterogeneous applications.

New in 2022.5.0
===============

New Features
------------
- Added new ``histogram`` algorithms for generating a histogram from an input sequence into
  an output sequence representing either equally spaced or user-defined bins.
  These algorithms are currently only available for device execution policies.
- Supported zip_iterator for ``transform`` algorithm.

Fixed Issues
------------
- Fixed handling of ``permutation_iterator`` as input to oneDPL algorithms for a variety of
  source iterator and permutation types which caused issues.
- Fixed ``zip_iterator`` to be `sycl device copyable`_ for trivially copyable source iterator types.
- Added a workaround for reduction algorithm failures with 64-bit data types. Define
  the ``ONEDPL_WORKAROUND_FOR_IGPU_64BIT_REDUCTION`` macro to ``1`` before including oneDPL header files.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
New in This Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Crashes or incorrect results may occur when using ``oneapi::dpl::reverse_iterator`` or
  ``std::reverse_iterator`` as input to oneDPL algorithms with device execution policies.

Existing Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
See oneDPL Guide for other `restrictions and known limitations`_.

- When compiled with ``-fsycl-pstl-offload`` option of Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ compiler and with
  ``libstdc++`` version 8 or ``libc++``, ``oneapi::dpl::execution::par_unseq`` offloads
  standard parallel algorithms to the SYCL device similarly to ``std::execution::par_unseq``
  in accordance with the ``-fsycl-pstl-offload`` option value.
- When using the dpl modulefile to initialize the user's environment and compiling with ``-fsycl-pstl-offload``
  option of Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ compiler, a linking issue or program crash may be encountered due to the directory
  containing libpstloffload.so not being included in the search path. Use the env/vars.sh to configure the working
  environment to avoid the issue.
- Compilation issues may be encountered when passing zip iterators to ``exclusive_scan_by_segment`` on Windows.
- Incorrect results may be produced by ``set_intersection`` with a DPC++ execution policy,
  where elements are copied from the second input range rather than the first input range. 
- For ``transform_exclusive_scan`` and ``exclusive_scan`` to run in-place (that is, with the same data
  used for both input and destination) and with an execution policy of ``unseq`` or ``par_unseq``, 
  it is required that the provided input and destination iterators are equality comparable.
  Furthermore, the equality comparison of the input and destination iterator must evaluate to true.
  If these conditions are not met, the result of these algorithm calls is undefined.
- ``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``sort_by_key``, ``partial_sort_copy`` algorithms may work incorrectly or cause
  a segmentation fault when used a DPC++ execution policy for CPU device, and built
  on Linux with Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler and -O0 -g compiler options.
  To avoid the issue, pass ``-fsycl-device-code-split=per_kernel`` option to the compiler.
- Incorrect results may be produced by ``exclusive_scan``, ``inclusive_scan``, ``transform_exclusive_scan``,
  ``transform_inclusive_scan``, ``exclusive_scan_by_segment``, ``inclusive_scan_by_segment``, ``reduce_by_segment``
  with ``unseq`` or ``par_unseq`` policy when compiled by Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler
  with ``-fiopenmp``, ``-fiopenmp-simd``, ``-qopenmp``, ``-qopenmp-simd`` options on Linux.
  To avoid the issue, pass ``-fopenmp`` or ``-fopenmp-simd`` option instead.
- Incorrect results may be produced by ``reduce``, ``reduce_by_segment``, and ``transform_reduce``
  with 64-bit data types when compiled by Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler versions 2021.3 and newer
  and executed on GPU devices.
  For a workaround, define the ``ONEDPL_WORKAROUND_FOR_IGPU_64BIT_REDUCTION`` macro to ``1`` before
  including oneDPL header files.
- ``std::tuple``, ``std::pair`` cannot be used with SYCL buffers to transfer data between host and device.
- ``std::array`` cannot be swapped in DPC++ kernels with ``std::swap`` function or ``swap`` member function
  in the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library.
- The ``oneapi::dpl::experimental::ranges::reverse`` algorithm is not available with ``-fno-sycl-unnamed-lambda`` option.
- STL algorithm functions (such as ``std::for_each``) used in DPC++ kernels do not compile with the debug version of
  the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library.

New in 2022.4.0
===============

New Features
------------
- Added experimental ``radix_sort`` and ``radix_sort_by_key`` algorithms residing in
  the ``oneapi::dpl::experimental::kt::esimd`` namespace. These algorithms are first
  in the family of _kernel templates_ that allow configuring a variety of parameters
  including the number of elements to process by a work item, and the size of a workgroup.
  The algorithms only work with Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series.
- Added new ``transform_if`` algorithm for applying a transform function conditionally
  based on a predicate, with overloads provided for one and two input sequences
  that use correspondingly unary and binary operations and predicates.
- Optimizations used with Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler are expanded to the open source oneAPI DPC++ compiler.

New in 2022.3.0
===============

New Features
------------
- Added an experimental feature to dynamically select an execution context, e.g., a SYCL queue.
  The feature provides selection functions such as ``select``, ``submit`` and ``submit_and_wait``,
  and several selection policies: ``fixed_resource_policy``, ``round_robin_policy``,
  ``dynamic_load_policy``, and ``auto_tune_policy``.
- ``unseq`` and ``par_unseq`` policies now enable vectorization also for Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.
- Added support for passing zip iterators as segment value data in ``reduce_by_segment``, ``exclusive_scan_by_segment``,
  and ``inclusive_scan_by_segment``.
- Improved performance of the ``merge``, ``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``sort_by_key``,
  ``reduce``, ``min_element``, ``max_element``, ``minmax_element``, ``is_partitioned``, and
  ``lexicographical_compare`` algorithms with DPC++ execution policies.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

New in This Release

Existing Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``exclusive_scan`` and ``transform_exclusive_scan`` algorithms may provide wrong results with vector execution policies
  when building a program with GCC 10 and using -O0 option.
- Some algorithms may hang when a program is built with -O0 option, executed on GPU devices and large number of elements is to be processed.
- The use of oneDPL together with the GNU C++ standard library (libstdc++) version 9 or 10 may lead to
  compilation errors (caused by oneTBB API changes).
  To overcome these issues, include oneDPL header files before the standard C++ header files,
  or disable parallel algorithms support in the standard library.
  For more information, please see `Intel® oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) Release Notes`_.
- The ``using namespace oneapi;`` directive in a oneDPL program code may result in compilation errors
  with some compilers including GCC 7 and earlier. Instead of this directive, explicitly use
  ``oneapi::dpl`` namespace, or create a namespace alias.
- The implementation does not yet provide ``namespace oneapi::std`` as defined in `the oneDPL Specification`_.

  or Clang 7 (or higher).
- ``std::tuple``, ``std::pair`` cannot be used with SYCL buffers to transfer data between host and device.
- When used within DPC++ kernels or transferred to/from a device, ``std::array`` can only hold objects
  whose type meets DPC++ requirements for use in kernels and for data transfer, respectively.
- ``std::array::at`` member function cannot be used in kernels because it may throw an exception;
  use ``std::array::operator[]`` instead.
- ``std::array`` cannot be swapped in DPC++ kernels with ``std::swap`` function or ``swap`` member function
  in the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library.
- Due to specifics of Microsoft* Visual C++, some standard floating-point math functions
  (including ``std::ldexp``, ``std::frexp``, ``std::sqrt(std::complex<float>)``) require device support
  for double precision.
- The ``oneapi::dpl::experimental::ranges::reverse`` algorithm is not available with ``-fno-sycl-unnamed-lambda`` option.

New in 2021.2
=============

New Features
------------
-  Added support of parallel, vector and DPC++ execution policies for the following algorithms: ``shift_left``, ``shift_right``.
-  Added the range-based versions of the following algorithms: ``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``merge``.
-  Added experimental asynchronous algorithms: ``copy_async``, ``fill_async``, ``for_each_async``, ``reduce_async``, ``sort_async``, ``transform_async``, ``transform_reduce_async``.
   These algorithms are declared in ``oneapi::dpl::experimental`` namespace and implemented only for DPC++ policies.
   In order to make these algorithms available the ``<oneapi/dpl/async>`` header should be included. Use of the asynchronous API requires C++11.
-  Utility function ``wait_for_all`` enables waiting for completion of an arbitrary number of events.
-  Added the ``ONEDPL_USE_PREDEFINED_POLICIES`` macro, which enables predefined policy objects and
   ``make_device_policy``, ``make_fpga_policy`` functions without arguments. It is turned on by default.

Changes to Existing Features
-----------------------------
- Improved performance of the following algorithms: ``count``, ``count_if``, ``is_partitioned``,
  ``lexicographical_compare``, ``max_element``, ``min_element``,  ``minmax_element``, ``reduce``, ``transform_reduce``,
  and ``sort``, ``stable_sort`` when using Radix sort [#fnote1]_.
- Improved performance of the linear_congruential_engine RNG engine (including ``minstd_rand``, ``minstd_rand0``,
  ``minstd_rand_vec``, ``minstd_rand0_vec`` predefined engines).

Fixed Issues
------------
- Fixed runtime errors occurring with ``find_end``, ``search``, ``search_n`` algorithms when a program is built with -O0 option and executed on CPU devices.
- Fixed the majority of unused parameter warnings.

Known Issues and Limitations
-----------------------------
- ``exclusive_scan`` and ``transform_exclusive_scan`` algorithms may provide wrong results with vector execution policies
  when building a program with GCC 10 and using -O0 option.
- Some algorithms may hang when a program is built with -O0 option, executed on GPU devices and large number of elements is to be processed.
- The use of oneDPL together with the GNU C++ standard library (libstdc++) version 9 or 10 may lead to
  compilation errors (caused by oneTBB API changes).
  To overcome these issues, include oneDPL header files before the standard C++ header files,
  or disable parallel algorithms support in the standard library.
  For more information, please see `Intel® oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) Release Notes`_.
- The ``using namespace oneapi;`` directive in a oneDPL program code may result in compilation errors
  with some compilers including GCC 7 and earlier. Instead of this directive, explicitly use
  ``oneapi::dpl`` namespace, or create a namespace alias.
- The implementation does not yet provide ``namespace oneapi::std`` as defined in `the oneDPL Specification`_.
- The use of the range-based API requires C++17 and the C++ standard libraries coming with GCC 8.1 (or higher)
  or Clang 7 (or higher).

  whose type meets DPC++ requirements for use in kernels and for data transfer, respectively.

  use ``std::array::operator[]`` instead.
- ``std::array`` cannot be swapped in DPC++ kernels with ``std::swap`` function or ``swap`` member function
  in the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library.
- Due to specifics of Microsoft* Visual C++, some standard floating-point math functions
  (including ``std::ldexp``, ``std::frexp``, ``std::sqrt(std::complex<float>)``) require device support
  for double precision.

New in 2021.1 Gold
===================

Key Features
-------------
- This version implements `the oneDPL Specification`_ v1.0, including parallel algorithms,
  DPC++ execution policies, special iterators, and other utilities.
- oneDPL algorithms can work with data in DPC++ buffers as well as in unified shared memory (USM).
- For several algorithms, experimental API that accepts ranges (similar to C++20) is additionally provided.
- A subset of the standard C++ libraries for Microsoft* Visual C++, GCC, and Clang is supported
  in DPC++ kernels, including ``<array>``, ``<complex>``, ``<functional>``, ``<tuple>``,
  ``<type_traits>``, ``<utility>`` and other standard library API.
  For the detailed list, please refer to `oneDPL Guide`_.
- Standard C++ random number generators and distributions for use in DPC++ kernels.
