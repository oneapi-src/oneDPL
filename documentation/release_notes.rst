Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) Release Notes
###################################################

Overview
=========

The Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) accompanies the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler
and provides high-productivity APIs aimed to minimize programming efforts of C++ developers
creating efficient heterogeneous applications.

New in 2021.5
=============

New Features
------------
- Added new random number distributions: ``exponential_distribution``, ``bernoulli_distribution``,
  ``geometric_distribution``, ``lognormal_distribution``, ``weibull_distribution``, ``cachy_distribution``, ``extreme_value_distribution``.
- Added the serial-based versions of the following algorithms: ``all_of``, ``any_of``, 
  ``none_of``, ``count``, ``count_if``, ``for_each``, ``find``, ``find_if``, ``find_if_not``.
  For the detailed list, please refer to `Tested Standard C++ API Reference`_. 
- Improved performance of ``search`` and ``find_end`` algorithms on GPU devices.

Fixed Issues
------------
- Fixed SYCL* 2020 features deprecation warnings.
- Fixed some corner cases of ``normal_distribution`` functionality.
- Fixed a floating point exception occurring on CPU devices when a program uses a lot of oneDPL algorithms and DPC++ kernels.
- Fixed possible hanging and data races of the following algorithms used with DPC++ execution policies: ``count``, ``count_if``, ``is_partitioned``, ``lexicographical_compare``, ``max_element``, ``min_element``, ``minmax_element``,    ``reduce``, ``transform_reduce``.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

New in This Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- The definition of lambda functions used with parallel algorithms should not depend on preprocessor macros
  that makes it different for the host and the device. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

Existing Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``exclusive_scan`` and ``transform_exclusive_scan`` algorithms may provide wrong results with vector execution policies
  when building a program with GCC 10 and using -O0 option.
- Some algorithms may hang when a program is built with -O0 option, executed on GPU devices and large number of elements is to be processed.
- The use of oneDPL together with the GNU C++ standard library (libstdc++) version 9 or 10 may lead to
  compilation errors (caused by oneTBB API changes).
  To overcome these issues, include oneDPL header files before the standard C++ header files,
  or disable parallel algorithms support in the standard library.
  For more information, please see `Intel® oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) Release Notes`_.
- The ``using namespace oneapi;`` directive in a oneDPL program code may result in compilation errors
  with some compilers including GCC 7 and earlier. Instead of this directive, explicitly use
  ``oneapi::dpl`` namespace, or create a namespace alias.
- The implementation does not yet provide ``namespace oneapi::std`` as defined in `the oneDPL Specification`_.
- The use of the range-based API requires C++17 and the C++ standard libraries coming with GCC 8.1 (or higher)
  or Clang 7 (or higher).
- ``std::tuple``, ``std::pair`` cannot be used with SYCL buffers to transfer data between host and device.
- When used within DPC++ kernels or transferred to/from a device, ``std::array`` can only hold objects
  whose type meets DPC++ requirements for use in kernels and for data transfer, respectively.
- ``std::array::at`` member function cannot be used in kernels because it may throw an exception;
  use ``std::array::operator[]`` instead.
- ``std::array`` cannot be swapped in DPC++ kernels with ``std::swap`` function or ``swap`` member function
  in the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library.
- Due to specifics of Microsoft* Visual C++, some standard floating-point math functions
  (including ``std::ldexp``, ``std::frexp``, ``std::sqrt(std::complex<float>)``) require device support
  for double precision.

New in 2021.4
=============

New Features
------------
-  Added the range-based versions of the following algorithms: ``any_of``, ``adjacent_find``,
   ``copy_if``, ``none_of``, ``remove_copy_if``, ``remove_copy``, ``replace_copy``, 
   ``replace_copy_if``, ``reverse``, ``reverse_copy``, ``rotate_copy``, ``swap_ranges``,
   ``unique``, ``unique_copy``.
-  Added new asynchronous algorithms: ``inclusive_scan_async``, ``exclusive_scan_async``,
   ``transform_inclusive_scan_async``, ``transform_exclusive_scan_async``.
-  Added structured binding support for ``zip_iterator::value_type``.

Fixed Issues
------------
-  Fixed an issue with asynchronous algorithms returning ``future<ptr>`` with unified shared memory (USM).

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

New in This Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-  With Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler, ``unseq`` and ``par_unseq`` execution policies do not use OpenMP SIMD pragmas
   due to compilation issues with the ``-fopenm-simd`` option, possibly resulting in suboptimal performance.
-  The ``oneapi::dpl::experimental::ranges::reverse`` algorithm does not compile with ``-fno-sycl-unnamed-lambda`` option.

Existing Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``exclusive_scan`` and ``transform_exclusive_scan`` algorithms may provide wrong results with vector execution policies
  when building a program with GCC 10 and using -O0 option.

  for double precision.

New in 2021.3
=============

New Features
------------
-  Added the range-based versions of the following algorithms: ``all_of``, ``any_of``, ``count``,
   ``count_if``, ``equal``, ``move``, ``remove``, ``remove_if``, ``replace``, ``replace_if``.
-  Added the following utility ranges (views): ``generate``, ``fill``, ``rotate``.

Changes to Existing Features
-----------------------------
-  Improved performance of ``discard_block_engine`` (including ``ranlux24``, ``ranlux48``,
   ``ranlux24_vec``, ``ranlux48_vec`` predefined engines) and ``normal_distribution``.
- Added two constructors to ``transform_iterator``: the default constructor and a constructor from an iterator without a transformation.
  ``transform_iterator`` constructed these ways uses transformation functor of type passed in template arguments.
- ``transform_iterator`` can now work on top of forward iterators.

Fixed Issues
------------
-  Fixed execution of ``swap_ranges`` algorithm with ``unseq``, ``par`` execution policies.
-  Fixed an issue causing memory corruption and double freeing in scan-based algorithms compiled with
   -O0 and -g options and run on CPU devices.
-  Fixed incorrect behavior in the ``exclusive_scan`` algorithm that occurred when the input and output iterator ranges overlapped.
-  Fixed error propagation for async runtime exceptions by consistently calling ``sycl::event::wait_and_throw`` internally.
-  Fixed the warning: ``local variable will be copied despite being returned by name [-Wreturn-std-move]``.

Known Issues and Limitations
-----------------------------
- No new issues in this release.

New in 2021.2
=============

New Features
------------

-  Added experimental asynchronous algorithms: ``copy_async``, ``fill_async``, ``for_each_async``, ``reduce_async``, ``sort_async``, ``transform_async``, ``transform_reduce_async``.
   These algorithms are declared in ``oneapi::dpl::experimental`` namespace and implemented only for DPC++ policies.
