oneDPL 2022.0 Changes
#####################

This page list the breaking changes that occurred between the 2021.7.1 and 2022.0 releases.
Support for C++11 and C++14 has been discontinued. 

The internal parameter n of discard_block_engine was changed
from a int to a std::size_t type to align its implementation with
the ะก++ std proposal found at https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue3561.
This change lets you utilize the full range of values for the P and R
template parameters of discard_block_engine.
 
 .. Note::

 Note: You may need to rebuild your code.
