Additional Macros
==================
Use these macros to control aspects of |onedpl_short| usage. You can set them in your program code
before including |onedpl_short| headers.

================================== ==============================
Macro                              Description
================================== ==============================
``PSTL_USE_NONTEMPORAL_STORES``    This macro enables the use of ``#pragma vector nontemporal``
                                   for write-only data when algorithms such as ``std::copy``, ``std::fill``, etc.,
                                   are executed with unsequenced policies.
                                   For further details about the pragma,
                                   see the `vector page in the IntelÂ® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler Developer Guide and Reference
                                   <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/dpcpp-cpp-compiler/developer-guide-reference/current/vector.html>`_.
                                   If the macro evaluates to a non-zero value,
                                   the use of ``#pragma vector nontemporal`` is enabled.
                                   By default, the macro is not defined.

                                   Using this macro may have the same effect on the implementation of parallel
                                   algorithms in the C++ standard libraries of GCC and LLVM.
---------------------------------- ------------------------------
``PSTL_USAGE_WARNINGS``            This macro enables Parallel STL to
                                   emit compile-time messages, such as warnings
                                   about an algorithm not supporting a certain execution policy.
                                   When set to 1, the macro allows the implementation to emit
                                   usage warnings. When the macro is not defined (by default)
                                   or evaluates to zero, usage warnings are disabled.

                                   Using this macro may have the same effect on the implementation of parallel
                                   algorithms in the C++ standard libraries of GCC and LLVM.
---------------------------------- ------------------------------
``ONEDPL_USE_TBB_BACKEND``         This macro controls the use of |onetbb_long| or |tbb_long| for parallel
                                   execution policies (``par`` and ``par_unseq``).

                                   When the macro evaluates to a non-zero value, or when it is not defined (by default)
                                   and no other parallel backends are explicitly chosen, algorithms with parallel policies
                                   are executed using the |onetbb_short| or |tbb_short| library.
                                   Setting the macro to 0 disables use of TBB API for parallel execution and is recommended
                                   for code that should not depend on the presence of the |onetbb_short| or |tbb_short| library.

                                   If all parallel backends are disabled by setting respective macros to 0, algorithms
                                   with parallel policies are executed sequentially by the calling thread.
---------------------------------- ------------------------------
``ONEDPL_USE_OPENMP_BACKEND``      This macro controls the use of OpenMP* for parallel execution policies (``par`` and ``par_unseq``).

                                   When the macro evaluates to a non-zero value, algorithms with parallel policies are executed
                                   using OpenMP unless the TBB backend is explicitly enabled (that is, the TBB backend takes
                                   precedence over the OpenMP backend).
                                   When the macro is not defined (by default) and no other parallel backends are chosen,
                                   a dedicated compiler option to enable OpenMP (such as ``-fopenmp``) also enables its use
                                   for algorithms with parallel policies.
                                   Setting the macro to 0 disables use of OpenMP for parallel execution.

                                   If all parallel backends are disabled by setting respective macros to 0, algorithms
                                   with parallel policies are executed sequentially by the calling thread.
---------------------------------- ------------------------------
``ONEDPL_USE_DPCPP_BACKEND``       This macro enables the use of the device execution policies.
                                   When the macro is not defined (by default)
                                   or evaluates to non-zero, device policies are enabled.
                                   When the macro is set to 0 there is no dependency on
                                   the |dpcpp_cpp| and runtime libraries.
                                   Trying to use device policies will lead to compilation errors.
---------------------------------- ------------------------------
``ONEDPL_USE_PREDEFINED_POLICIES`` This macro enables the use of predefined device policy objects,
                                   such as ``dpcpp_default`` and ``dpcpp_fpga``. When the macro is not defined (by default)
                                   or evaluates to non-zero, predefined policies objects can be used.
                                   When the macro is set to 0, predefined policies objects and make functions
                                   without arguments, when ``make_device_policy()``,
                                   ``make_fpga_policy()``, are not available.
---------------------------------- ------------------------------
``ONEDPL_ALLOW_DEFERRED_WAITING``  This macro allows waiting for completion of certain algorithms executed with
                                   device policies to be deferred. (Disabled by default.)
---------------------------------- ------------------------------
``ONEDPL_FPGA_DEVICE``             Use this macro to build your code containing |onedpl_short| parallel
                                   algorithms for FPGA devices. (Disabled by default.)
---------------------------------- ------------------------------
``ONEDPL_FPGA_EMULATOR``           Use this macro to build your code containing Parallel STL
                                   algorithms for FPGA emulation device. (Disabled by default.)

                                   .. Note:: Define ``ONEDPL_FPGA_DEVICE`` and ``ONEDPL_FPGA_EMULATOR`` macros in the same
                                      application to run on a FPGA emulation device.
                                      Define only the ``ONEDPL_FPGA_DEVICE`` macro to run on a FPGA hardware device.
