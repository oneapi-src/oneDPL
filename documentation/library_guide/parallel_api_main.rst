Parallel API
############

Parallel API is an implementation of the C++ standard libraries algorithms and execution
policies, as specified in the ISO/IEC 14882:2017 standard (commonly called C++17). The implementation
supports the unsequenced execution policy and the ``shift_left``/``shift_right`` algorithms, which are specified
in the final draft of the C++ 20 standard (N4860). For more details see the `C++ Standard Execution
Policies <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag_t>`_. |onedpl_long| (|onedpl_short|)
provides specific versions of the algorithms, including:

* Segmented reduce
* Segmented scan
* Vectorized search algorithms

Parallel API offers support for the parallel and vectorized execution of algorithms on Intel®
processors and heterogeneity support with a DPC++ based implementation for device execution policies.
For sequential execution, |onedpl_short| relies on an available implementation of the C++ standard library.

The utility API includes iterators and function object classes. The iterators implement
zip, transform, complete permutation operations on other iterators, and include a counting and discard iterator.
The function object classes provide minimum, maximum, and identity operations
that may be passed to algorithms such as reduce or transform.

|onedpl_short| also includes an experimental implementation of range-based algorithms with their
required ranges and Async API.
