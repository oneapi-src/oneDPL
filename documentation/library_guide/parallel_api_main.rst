Parallel API

Introduction to Parallel API
============================

Algorithms
==========

Parallel API is an implementation of the C++ standard library algorithms and execution
policies, as specified in ISO/IEC 14882:2017 standard, commonly called C++17. The implementation also
supports the unsequenced execution policy and the ``shift_left`` and ``shift_right`` algorithms, which are specified
in the final draft for the C++ 20 standard (N4860). For more details see the `C++ Standard Execution
Policies <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag_t>`_. In addition to that |onedpl_short| provides
specific versions of the algorithms including segmented reduce, segmented scan and vectorized search algorithms.

Parallel API offers efficient support for both parallel and vectorized execution of
algorithms for IntelÂ® processors as well as heterogeneity support with |dpcpp_short| execution policies.
For sequential execution, it relies on an available implementation of the C++ standard library.

The utility API includes iterators, and function object classes. The iterators implement
zip, transform, and permutation operations on other iterators, and also include a counting iterator
and a discard iterator. The function object classes provide minimum, maximum and identity operations
that may be passed to algorithms such as reduce or transform.

|onedpl_short| also includes an experimental implementation of range-based algorithms with ranges required
to use them and async api.
