|onedpl_long| (|onedpl_short|) includes the following APIs for SYCL* kernels:

* :doc:`Tested Standard C++ APIs <api_for_sycl_kernels/tested_standard_cpp_api>`. The basic
  functionality for several C++ standard APIs has been tested for use in SYCL kernels.
* :doc:`Random Number Generators <api_for_sycl_kernels/random>`. Support of random number generation
  including engines and distributions.
* :doc:`Utility Function Object Classes <api_for_sycl_kernels/utility_function_object_classes>`. Various
