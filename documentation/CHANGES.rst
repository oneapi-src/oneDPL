  C++17 is the minimal required version going forward.
  
Fixed Issues
------------
- Fixed a kernel name definition error in range-based algorithms and ``reduce_by_segment`` used with
  a device_policy object that has no explicit kernel name.
  
Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
New in This Release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- STL algorithm functions (such as ``std::for_each``) used in DPC++ kernels do not compile with the debug version of
  the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library.

=============

New Features
------------
- Added a new implementation for ``par`` and ``par_unseq`` execution policies based on OpenMP* 4.5 pragmas.
  It can be enabled with the ``ONEDPL_USE_OPENMP_BACKEND`` macro.
  For more details, see `Macros`_ page in oneDPL Guide.
- Added the range-based version of the ``reduce_by_segment`` algorithm and improved performance of
  the iterator-based ``reduce_by_segment`` APIs.

  Recompilation is recommended for all codes that might use ``param_type``.

Fixed Issues
------------
- Fixed hangs and errors when oneDPL is used together with oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) in DPC++ programs.
- Fixed possible data races in the following algorithms used with DPC++ execution
  policies: ``sort``, ``stable_sort``, ``partial_sort``, ``nth_element``.

These algorithms are declared in ``oneapi::dpl::experimental`` namespace with suffix _async and implemented only for DPC++ policies. In order to make these algorithms available the ``<oneapi/dpl/async>`` header should be included. Use of the non-blocking API requires C++11.
-  Utility function ``wait_for_all`` enables waiting for completion of an arbitrary number of events.

  or disable parallel algorithms support in the standard library. For more information, please see `Intel® oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) Release Notes`_.
- The ``using namespace oneapi;`` directive in a oneDPL program code may result in compilation errors
  with some compilers including GCC 7 and earlier. Instead of this directive, explicitly use
  ``oneapi::dpl`` namespace, or create a namespace alias.
- The implementation does not yet provide ``namespace oneapi::std`` as defined in `the oneDPL Specification`_.
- The use of the range-based API requires C++17 and the C++ standard libraries coming with GCC 8.1 (or higher)
  or Clang 7 (or higher).
- ``std::tuple``, ``std::pair`` cannot be used with SYCL buffers to transfer data between host and device.

  whose type meets DPC++ requirements for use in kernels and for data transfer, respectively.
- ``std::array::at`` member function cannot be used in kernels because it may throw an exception;
  use ``std::array::operator[]`` instead.
- ``std::array`` cannot be swapped in DPC++ kernels with ``std::swap`` function or ``swap`` member function
  in the Microsoft* Visual C++ standard library.
- Due to specifics of Microsoft* Visual C++, some standard floating-point math functions
  (including ``std::ldexp``, ``std::frexp``, ``std::sqrt(std::complex<float>)``) require device support
  for double precision.

New in 2021.1-beta05
====================

Changes to Existing Features
-----------------------------
- Improved USM pointers support.

Note: Non-USM pointers are not supported by the DPC++ execution policies anymore.
- A performance optimization for partial_sort, partial_sort_copy algorithms using standard C++ policies.

Fixed Issues
-------------
- Fix for non-trivial user’s type using the ``remove_if``, ``unique``, ``rotate``, ``partial_sort_copy``, ``set_intersetion``, ``set_union``, ``set_difference``, ``set_symmetric_difference`` algorithms with standard C++ policies.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
- Some algorithms might fail on CPU when using DPC++ policy.
- ``std::tuple`` cannot be used with SYCL buffers to transfer data between host and device.
- When used within DPC++ kernels or transferred to/from a device, ``std::tuple, std::pair`` and ``std::array`` can only hold objects whose type meets DPC++ requirements for use in kernels and for data transfer, respectively.
- ``std::array::at`` member function cannot be used in kernels because it may throw an exception; use ``std::array::operator[]`` instead.
- ``std::array`` member function swap cannot be used in DPC++ kernels on Windows platform.
- ``std::swap`` for ``std::array`` cannot work in DPC++ kernels on Windows platform.
- Not all functions in <cmath> are supported currently, please refer to `DPC++ library guide <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onedpl/developer-guide/current/overview.html>`_ for detail list.
- ``std::complex`` division may fail in kernel code on some CPU platform.

New in 2021.1-beta04
====================

New Features
-------------
- Added 64-bit atomics support.
- Added the following to Tested standard C++ APIs:

  - ``<complex>`` and most functions in ``<cmath>`` (GNU* libstdc++);
  - ``<ratio>`` (GNU libstdc++, LLVM* libc++, MSVC*);
  - ``std::numeric_limits`` (GNU libstdc++, MSVC).


Changes to Existing Features
-----------------------------
- The following DPC++ execution policies were renamed:

  - From ``dpstd::execution::sycl_policy`` to ``dpstd::execution::device_policy``.
  - From ``dpstd::execution::make_sycl_policy`` to ``dpstd::execution::make_device_policy``.
  - From ``dpstd::execution::sycl`` object to ``dpstd::execution::default_policy``.

``dpstd::execution::sycl_policy, dpstd::execution::make_sycl_policy, dpstd::execution::sycl`` were deprecated.

- The following algorithms in Extension API were renamed:

  - From ``reduce_by_key`` to ``reduce_by_segment``.
  - From ``inclusive_scan_by_key`` to ``inclusive_scan_by_segment``.
  - From ``exclusive_scan_by_key`` to ``exclusive_scan_by_segment``.


Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
- Using DPC++ policy some algorithms might fail on CPU.

New in 2021.1-beta03
====================

New Features
-------------
- Added support for Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) to Parallel STL algorithms. For a complete list of Parallel STL algorithms see the ISO/IEC 14882:2017 standard (C++17).
- Added ``dpstd::begin``, ``dpstd::end`` helper functions to pass a ``sycl::buffer`` into Parallel STL algorithms.
- Added initial support for Unified Shared Memory in Parallel STL algorithms.
- More than 80 C++ standard APIs from ``<algorithm>``, ``<array>``, ``<tuple>``, ``<utility>``, ``<functional>``, ``<type_traits>``, ``<initializer_list>`` were tested for use in DPC++ kernels. For more information, see the library guide.
- Added ``counting_iterator``, ``zip_iterator``, ``transform_iterator``, ``reduce_by_key``, ``inclusive_scan_by_key``, and ``exclusive_scan_by_key`` to the extension API.
- Added functional utility classes that include identity, minimum, maximum to the extension API.

Changes to Existing Features
----------------------------
- Construction of a DPC++ execution policy from a ``sycl::ordered`` queue.

Fixed Issues
------------
- Errors no longer appear when the ``<dpstd/execution>`` header is included after other the oneDPL headers.
- Algorithms now work with zip iterators if standard C++ execution policies are used.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------
- Algorithms ``adjacent_find``, ``find``, ``find_end``, ``find_first_of``, ``find_if``, ``find_if_not``, ``is_sorted``, ``is_sorted_until``, ``mismatch``, ``search``, and ``search_n`` do not use iterators with the size of difference_type more than 32 bits.
- ``std::tuple`` cannot be used with SYCL* buffers to transfer data between the host and device.
- When used within DPC++ kernels or transferred to or from a device, ``std::tuple``, ``std::pair``, and ``std::array`` can only hold objects whose type meets DPC++ requirements for use in kernels and for data transfer, respectively.
- ``std::array::at`` member function cannot be used in kernels because it may throw an exception; use ``std::array::operator[]`` instead.
- A ``std::array`` member function swap and ``std::swap`` for ``std::array`` cannot be used in DPC++ kernels on Windows* platforms.
