oneDPL is part of the [UXL Foundation] and is an implementation of the
[oneAPI specification] for the oneDPL component.

[UXL Foundation]: http://www.uxlfoundation.org
[oneAPI specification]: https://spec.oneapi.io

oneDPL works with the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler to provide high-productivity
APIs to developers, which can minimize Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) programming efforts
across devices for high performance parallel applications.
