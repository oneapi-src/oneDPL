# oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL)

The oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) aims to work with the oneAPI DPC++ Compiler
to provide high-productivity APIs to developers, which can minimize DPC++
programming efforts across devices for high performance parallel applications.
oneDPL consists of following components:
* Parallel STL for DPC++
* An additional set of library classes and functions (referred below as "Extension API")
* Tested standard C++ APIs
