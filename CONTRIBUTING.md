  [coding conventions](#coding-conventions).
- Test your code locally to identify and resolve simple issues by doing
  [validation testing](#validation-testing).
- Submit a
  [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) into the

# Coding Conventions

Running clang-format is required, except in the [test folder](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDPL/tree/main/test).

# Validation Testing

oneDPL validation tests can be configured through CMake to run on different devices including CPU and GPU by specifying the oneDPL backend to use and
the device type to be used if the DPC++ backend is being tested. The oneTBB and OpenMP backends for oneDPL can be used when the device type is CPU or HOST.

To run oneDPL validation tests on the gpu on your local system using the IntelÂ® oneAPI DPC++ Compiler 

1. Configure the Makefiles by running the following command from the [test folder](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDPL/tree/main/test).
```
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpx -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DONEDPL_BACKEND=dpcpp
-DONEDPL_DEVICE_TYPE=gpu -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..
```

2. Build the tests
```
cmake --build . --target build-onedpl-tests # specify a specific test name (e.g., reduce.pass) to build a single test
```

3. Run the tests
```
ctest --output-on-failure --timeout 1200 -R ^reduce.pass$ # Add -R testname (e.g., -R ^reduce.pass$) to run just one test.
```
